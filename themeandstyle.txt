For Handcrafted Haven, the color scheme and design theme should reflect the artisanal and handcrafted nature of the products being sold, with a focus on warmth, sustainability, and community. Below is a suggestion for the theme:

Color Scheme
Primary Colors:
Earthy Tones: Warm browns, beiges, and greens to reflect nature and handmade craftsmanship.
Example: #8B5E3C (Brown), #D1B097 (Light Beige), #A8D5BA (Soft Green)
Accent Colors:
Muted Gold: For highlighting important elements like buttons and headings.
Example: #D1A15D
Subtle Coral: For minor highlights or notifications.
Example: #FF6B6B
Background Color:
Off-white or light beige: Provides a clean, neutral backdrop that doesn’t distract from the products.
Example: #F7F3E9 (Light Beige)
Typography
Primary Font:
Serif font for headings (to emphasize a handcrafted, timeless feel):
Example: Playfair Display or Merriweather.
Sans-serif font for body text (for readability and modern feel):
Example: Poppins or Open Sans.
Font Weights:
Use bold or semi-bold for headings and important elements.
Use regular or light for body text and secondary elements.
Layout and Design Elements
General Layout:
The site should have a two-column layout for product listings (with filter options on the left side and products displayed on the right).
The homepage should have a hero section at the top featuring a large image carousel with popular products and promotions.
Navigation Bar: Should be sticky, with links to the homepage, product categories, seller profiles, and the cart.
Cards for Product Listings: Each product should be displayed in a card with an image, title, brief description, price, and a rating system.
Buttons: Rounded buttons with hover effects, using the Muted Gold for important actions like "Add to Cart" or "Buy Now".
Form Inputs: Simple, rounded input fields for filters, reviews, and contact forms.
Footer: Contains quick links, social media icons, and a brief description of the platform.
Design Tools
Figma: Use Figma for wireframes and creating mockups of the homepage, product pages, and user flows.
Adobe XD: Alternatively, use Adobe XD if Figma isn’t preferred.
Sketch: If available, Sketch can also be used to create high-fidelity designs.
